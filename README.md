# 3D LiDAR Topography Visualization

![3D LiDAR Topography Visualization](LidarLand.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows visualization of a LiDAR scanned 3D object with LightningChart JS 3D Charts

This is LiDAR data of Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park, Inyo County, California with 1.139.662 points
 
LightningChart JS is suitable for really fast visualization of LiDAR data sets in range of tens of millions samples, with 3D points or 3D surface. This example shows the approach with points. In this example, each point is coloured dynamically by their Y coordinate according to a value -> color lookup table.

Lidar data from: [Philipp Urech](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/badwater-basin-30-sections-across-a-wash-ca8eebf6798d4b0a967336e16f066754) - Licensed under Creative Commons Attribute.
